### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Recently complete UNH Fullstack Web Developement bootcamp!Looking to get into the field and improve upon the skills I had learned, as well as learn new technologies! I have been building computers for about 7 years, mainly for my friends and myself(purely for the nature of gaming). I have since grown bored of it and decided to change to the coding side, seeming more interesting on how everything works behind the scenes. I'm very open to constructive critism and any advice you may have to give!!
